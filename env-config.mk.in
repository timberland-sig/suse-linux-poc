### Settings for the test environment ###

# You need to change these settings just once when you start, it at all.
# *If* you need change anything here, run "make net-down server-destroy" first.

### NETWORK SETTINGS

# Set this to 1 to enable creating the OVS bridge "ovs_nvme"
# This affects network and server setup only, and requires
# openvswitch to be installed and running
NVME_USE_OVS :=

#### IP address ranges
# Make sure this doesn't overlap with existing networks in your environment!
# addresses will be constructed as follows (decimal arithmetic also for IPv6!)
# For the br_nvme bridge:
# IPv4: $IP4_PREFIX.$((SUBNET_BASE-1)).x (default 192.168.49.x)
# IPv6: $ULA_PREFIX:$((SUBNET_BASE-1))::x (default fddf:d:f:49::x)
# For OVS (if enabled):
# IPv4: $IP4_PREFIX.$((SUBNET_BASE+OVS_VLAN_ID)).x (default e.g. 192.168.51.x)
# IPv6: $ULA_PREFIX:$((SUBNET_BASE+OVS_VLAN_ID)::x
# 192.168.50.x for VLAN 0 and 192.168.52.x for VLAN 2, IPv6 accordingly
IP4_PREFIX := 192.168
ULA_PREFIX := fddf:d:f
SUBNET_BASE := 50
# VLAN port to set up in OVS (if enabled; use value between 1 and 9)
OVS_VLAN_ID := 1

### SERVER SETTINGS

# Number of namespaces ("disks") to create export from the nvmet server
# Usually this will be one disk per NVMeoF client
# If this is > 4, please edit nvmet-server/group_vars/nvme_servers
NVME_MAX_NAMESPACES := 2
