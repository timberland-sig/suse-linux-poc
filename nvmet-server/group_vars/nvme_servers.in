# Definition of subsystems and namespaces (see roles/nvmet/defaults)
#
# nvme_subsystems is an array. The first entry corresponds to SUBSYS=01, etc.
# Every subsystem definition consists of two fields "disks" and "hosts".
# "disks" is an array of disk numbers. Disks are numbered from 1,
#    the largest number is max_namespaces.
#    A subsystem can have multiple disks, but every disk can only be
#    attached to one subsystem.
# "hosts" is an array of allowed host UUIDs.
#    The UUIDs should match the UUIDs of NVMeoF clients.
#    A host can be member of several subsystem's host lists.
# The "ffff" string below will be automatically replaced by the first
# created VM's UUID. Additional entries must be made manually.
#
# The template below assumes that every subsystem contains 1 disk and is
# exported to 1 host. That isn't necessarily so, but allows automatic fill-in
# of the host UUID by the Makefile, using the SUBSYS variable from config.mk
