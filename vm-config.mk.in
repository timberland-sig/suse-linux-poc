# Otherwise, set to 0

# e.g. Static4, Dhcp6

# Set to 1 to use the host system as gateway.
# If emtpy, the networks will be isolated.

### NVME SETTINGS

# Set to 1 to use NVMe discovery

# If DISCOVERY is emtpy, subsystem number to use to construct subsystem NQN
# If subsys <= NVME_MAX_NAMESPACES, this subsys will be auto-enabled for
# the UUID of VM_NAME

### DISTRIBUTION-SPECIFIC SETTINGS

# Set this to "leap" or "sle"
BASE_DIST := leap
# Always use leap versioning scheme, e.g. 15.4 here
